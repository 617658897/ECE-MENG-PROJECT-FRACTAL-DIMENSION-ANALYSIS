It's a template on which we can build a React app and call endpoints to make predictions about fractal dimension analysis.

## Install

First run the UI on server. Go inside the ui folder.

```sh
$ yarn install
```
```sh
$ npm install -g serve
```
```sh
$ npm run build
```
```sh
$ serve -s build -l 3000
```
The next step is to prepare the service. Open the second terminal and move inside the service folder.

```sh
$ flask run
```
